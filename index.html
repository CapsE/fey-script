        # Fey-Script
        Fey-Script is a superset of the markdown syntax that enhances it by adding interactive elements, import and export logic,
        structual elements to handle document flow and much more.

        ## Markdown
        Use the well known markdown syntax to style your text, add tables and images and much more.

        ## Front matter
        You can define data at the beginning of your document to be used with it. To do so write YAML code between
        two lines with three dashes. This block needs to be at the very top of your document.

        ```fey
        ---
        info: Use "front matter" to supply initial data to your document
        name: Nira
        str: 10
        dex: 15
        con: 8
        int: 10
        wis: 14
        cha: 12
        ---
        ```

        ## Structual Elements
        You can wrap your markdown syntax in different containers to change how they are displayed.

        ### HTML
        You can write HTML code within Fey-Script. While Fey-Script comes with a bunch of useful tools and shortcuts
        if you know your way around the HTML and CSS languages you can include them in Fey-Script to achieve even more.
        Keep in mind though that Fey-Script within HTML-Elements won't be parsed automatically.
        ```fey
        <div style="background-color: darkmagenta; padding: 1rem;">
          Some text on dark magenta background that can't be __bold__ because Fey-Script and markdown don't work within HTML.
        </div>
        ```

        <div style="background-color: darkmagenta; padding: 1rem;">
          Some text on dark magenta background that can be __bold__ because Fey-Script and markdown still works within HTML.
        </div>

        ### Card
        Cards are small boxes that seperate their content from the rest of the document. They're great to give a preview
        or a small overview or put focus on something important. You can create a card by using double square brackets

        ```fey
        [[
          ### Card
          This is the content of the card. It can be any valid fey-script code.
        ]]
        ```

        [[
        ### Card
        This is the content of the card. It can be any valid fey-script code.
        ]]

        ### Row
        The row will display contained elements next to each other with a bit of spacing and break automatically
        into the next row if no more space is available.

        ```fey
          :::row
            [[
              ### First Card
              This card contains some test text.
            ]]
            [[
              ### Second Card
              This card contains some test text.
            ]]
          :::
        ```
        :::row
        [[
          ### First Card
          This card contains some test text.
        ]]
        [[
          ### Second Card
          This card contains some test text.
        ]]
        :::

        ### Grid
        Using the grid container you can define columns with relative sizes. In this example a grid of 1-2-1 is used
        which means the center column is twice as wide as the outer ones. You can use as many columns as you like so
        1-1-1-1-1-1-1 would give you seven columns of equal size.

        ```fey
        :::grid-1-2-1
        <div style="background-color: darkcyan; padding: 1rem">

        </div>
        <div style="background-color: darkblue; padding: 1rem">

        </div>
        <div style="background-color: darkmagenta; padding: 1rem">

        </div>
        :::
        ```

        :::grid-1-2-1
        <div style="background-color: darkcyan; padding: 1rem">

        </div>
        <div style="background-color: darkblue; padding: 1rem">

        </div>
        <div style="background-color: darkmagenta; padding: 1rem">

        </div>
        :::

        ## Interactive Elements
        You can use inputs and variables to control the rendering of your document. Using double curly brackets
        you can output any value within the document.

        ```fey
        __Name:__ {{name}}
        ```

        __Name:__ {{name}}

        ### Inputs
        Inputs are defined by writing "i" followed by a variable name in square brackets. They allow you to edit
        variables on the fly and the document will react to the changes. You can provide optional settings to your
        input by writing them in JSON format after a |. Most attributes of HTML input elements are supported as well
        as a "label" attribute to override the label that will be automatically generated. The default type for inputs
        is number.

        ```fey
        i[name|{"type":"text"}]
        ```

        i[name|{"type":"text"}]

        ### Selects
        Selects work just like inputs but give the user a list of available values to choose from instead.

        ```fey
        s[className][
          Warrior
          Rogue
          Mage
        ]
        ```

        s[className][
          Warrior
          Rogue
          Mage
        ]

        ### Conditional Block
        It's possible to wrap parts of your document in a conditional if block. The wrapped content will only be shown
        when the condition is met. Conditions are written as Javascript.

        ```fey
        :::if className === "Warrior"
        You choose the Warrior class. You are strong and know how to fight.
        :::

        :::if className === "Rogue"
        You choose the Rogue class. You are sneaky and know how to get out of sticky situations.
        :::

        :::if className === "Mage"
        You choose the Mage class. You are intelligent and know how to cast magic
        :::
        ```

        :::if className === "Warrior"
        You choose the Warrior class. You are strong and know how to fight.
        :::

        :::if className === "Rogue"
        You choose the Rogue class. You are sneaky and know how to get out of sticky situations.
        :::

        :::if className === "Mage"
        You choose the Mage class. You are intelligent and know how to cast magic
        :::

        ### Dice Notation
        When writing text it'll be scanned for dice notation like +5, 2d6+2 or 1d4. Text like this will be highlighted
        like a link and can be clicked to generate dice results for the given notation.

        ```fey
        No special code needed. +5, 2d6+2 or 1d4 and others will just work.
        ```

        ### DnD Stats
        Fey-Script comes with a shortcut to calculate DnD attribute modifiers. You'd be able to calculate them just fine
        using the curly brackets but your document would get quite long. Write $mod and pass a variable name in round brackets
        to calculate the DnD Modifier.

        ```fey
        |                |               |               |               |               |               |
        |----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
        | i[str]         | i[dex]        | i[con]        | i[int]        | i[wis]        | i[cha]        |
        | {{$mod(str)}}  | {{$mod(dex)}} | {{$mod(con)}} | {{$mod(int)}} | {{$mod(wis)}} | {{$mod(cha)}} |
        ```

        |                |               |               |               |               |               |
        |----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
        | i[str]         | i[dex]        | i[con]        | i[int]        | i[wis]        | i[cha]        |
        | {{$mod(str)}}  | {{$mod(dex)}} | {{$mod(con)}} | {{$mod(int)}} | {{$mod(wis)}} | {{$mod(cha)}} |



        ## Tabs
        Tabs are a great way to group information and hide things that rarely come into play away from the spotlight
        while still having it accessible.

        ```fey
        |-- Tab One ---
        |
        | Tabs are great! I want to see this information most of the time!
        |
        |-- Tab Two ---
        |
        | But sometimes this information is required so I just switch over here.
        |
        |---
        ```

        |-- Tab One ---

        |

        ## Images
        You can use images within Fey-Script just like in regular Markdown but there is an additional feature
        to crop your images. Keep in mind that the actual file size doesn't change using this feature and it only
        affects how images are displayed.

        ```fey
        Regular display of an image
        ![image](fireball.png)

        The image will be displayed with a width of 300px. It's height will adjust to keep the original aspect ratio.
        ![image](fireball.png?width=300px)

        The image will be displayed with a height of 300px. It's width will adjust to keep the original aspect ratio.
        ![image](fireball.png?height=300px)

        The image will be displayed with width of 300px and height of 100px.
        ![image](fireball.png?width=300px&height=100px)

        The image will be displayed with a ratio of 16:9 cropping parts of the image around the center.
        ![image](fireball.png?aspectRatio=16/9)

        The image will be display in portrait mode focusing on the top left and cropping the bottom right.
        ![image](fireball.png?aspectRatio=2/3&focus=top left)
        ```

        Regular display of an image
        ![image](fireball.png)

        The image will be displayed with a width of 150px. It's height will adjust to keep the original aspect ratio.
        ![image](fireball.png?width=150px)

        The image will be displayed with a height of 200px. It's width will adjust to keep the original aspect ratio.
        ![image](fireball.png?height=200px)

        The image will be displayed with width of 300px and height of 100px.
        ![image](fireball.png?width=300px&height=100px)

        The image will be displayed with a ratio of 16:9 cropping parts of the image around the center.
        ![image](fireball.png?aspectRatio=16/9)

        The image will be display in portrait mode focusing on the top left and cropping the bottom right.
        ![image](fireball.png?height=300px&aspectRatio=2/3&focus=top-left)

        The image will be display as 300px by 200px focusing on the top and cropping the bottom.
        ![image](fireball.png?width=300px&height=200px&focus=top)

        ## Imports
        You can import Fey-Script files into your document a few different ways. Using curly brackets and the ">" sign
        will import the content of the given file and insert it straight into your document.
        If you're using square brackets instead, you'll create a card that will display the first headline of the imported
        file as title, the first image as an image and look for the key "description" in the frontmatter data to display
        it on the card.

        ```fey
        {{> text }}

        [[> fireball ]]
        ```

        {{> text }}

        [[> fireball ]]

      </fey-viewer>
    </div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
    <script>
      import('/src/importables/importables.js').then((module) => {
        const importables = module.importables;
        const viewer = document.getElementById('viewer');
        viewer.resolveImports = resolveImport;
        viewer.addEventListener('onDiceRoll', (e) => {
          alert(e.detail.result.output);
        });

        function resolveImport(path) {
          return new Promise((resolve) => {
            resolve(importables[path]);
          });
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
